Add a script to this file to ask the user to rate their mood from 1 to 10. 
Then do the following:
- change "msg" to say "Your Mood: x", where X is the number they entered. 
- If they enter a number in the range 1 to 3, change the image to "sad.png". 
If the number is 8-10 change it to "happy.png". Otherwise leave it as is. 
- Change the href attribute of "msg" so that it links to happy.com, sad.com or
 neutral.com as appropriate.
